# Cut a Release

This guide is for a maintainer releasing a new version of Guardline: bumping the version, settling the changelog, tagging, and publishing the package to PyPI and as a GitHub release. It assumes a clean checkout of `main` with the test suite green. It differs from the Stratarc release guide in one way, on purpose: Stratarc uploads by hand with `twine`, while Guardline publishes through PyPI trusted publishing, so no upload token exists to leak and a required approval stands between a pushed tag and PyPI.

## One-Time Setup

Do this once, before the first release.

1. On PyPI, open your account's publishing settings and add a pending trusted publisher with project name `guardline`, owner `klappe-pm`, repository `guardline`, workflow `release.yml` and environment `pypi`.
2. On GitHub, open the repository settings and create an environment named `pypi`. Add yourself as a required reviewer, so every upload waits for your approval. Under deployment branches and tags, allow only tags that match `v*`. Turn off the option that lets administrators bypass the protection rules, so the approval cannot be skipped.
3. In the repository's rulesets, add a tag ruleset that targets `v*` and restricts who can create those tags to the maintainers. Restrict updating and deleting them too, so a published tag cannot be moved.

## Where the Version Lives

The version is `__version__` in `guardline/__init__.py`. `pyproject.toml` declares the version as dynamic and reads it from that file through hatchling, so it is set in one place. The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Steps

1. Decide the new version from the Unreleased section of [the changelog](../../CHANGELOG.md): a breaking change bumps the major version, a new capability bumps the minor, a fix bumps the patch. A version number that was ever uploaded to PyPI can never be reused, even after it is deleted.
2. Set `__version__` in `guardline/__init__.py`.
3. In the changelog, rename Unreleased to the version and the date, written `## 0.1.0 (2026-10-20)` with no dash, and open a new empty Unreleased section above it.
4. Check the README, which PyPI shows as the project page. Every link in it must be absolute, because a relative link breaks there, and the text of a published version can never be changed, so a fix ships as a new version. For the first release, delete the sentence that says nothing is published yet and the install-from-GitHub block after it, in the README and in [Install](install.md).
5. Run the full set of checks:

```bash
cd guardline && python3 -m pytest && ruff check . && ruff format --check . && mypy
```

6. Build the distributions and check them. `twine check` fails on a README that PyPI cannot render:

```bash
cd guardline && python3 -m pip install build twine && python3 -m build --outdir dist && python3 -m twine check dist/*
```

7. Commit as `chore: release <version>` and merge it through a pull request like any other change.
8. Tag the merge commit `v<version>` and push the tag. Pushing the tag starts the release workflow:

```bash
cd guardline && git tag -a v<version> -m "guardline <version>" && git push origin v<version>
```

9. Open the workflow run on GitHub. When the build and test jobs have passed, approve the `pypi` environment. The publish job then uploads the distributions the build job made, and nothing else.
10. Create a GitHub release on the tag with the changelog section as its notes.

## What the Workflow Does

`.github/workflows/release.yml` has three jobs, and `tests/test_release_workflow.py` fails if any of these properties is lost.

- **Build.** Installs only the hash pinned `build` and `hatchling` from `requirements/build.txt`, fails unless the tagged commit is an ancestor of `origin/main`, fails unless the tag equals `v` plus the package version, builds the sdist and wheel without build isolation, and writes `sha256sum dist/*` to the job summary so you can compare the checksums with your local build.
- **Test.** Installs the hash pinned test tools from `requirements/ci.txt` and the wheel the build job made, removes the checkout's `guardline` folder so the tests import the wheel and not the source tree, and runs the suite.
- **Publish.** Needs both, runs in the `pypi` environment, and is the only job that can request an identity token.

Every action is pinned to a full commit hash with its version in a comment. The workflow can read the repository and nothing else, except the publish job. Checkout does not keep the GitHub token on disk.

## Updating the Pinned Tools

The lock files are generated with `pip-compile` from the small `.in` files next to them, for Python 3.11 on Linux. Regenerate them with a Python 3.11 environment that has `pip-tools`:

```bash
cd guardline && pip-compile --generate-hashes --strip-extras --output-file=requirements/ci.txt requirements/ci.in
```

```bash
cd guardline && pip-compile --generate-hashes --strip-extras --output-file=requirements/build.txt requirements/build.in
```

To move an action to a new release, look up the commit its tag points at, using the commit the annotated tag dereferences to when there is one, and keep the version comment in step:

```bash
git ls-remote --tags https://github.com/actions/checkout "refs/tags/v7.0.1*"
```

## After the Release

Confirm that `pipx install guardline==<version>` works, that `guardline --version` prints the version, and that the project page on pypi.org renders the README with working links.
