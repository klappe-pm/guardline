# Contributing

Thank you for helping improve Guardline. Open an issue to discuss a change before writing a large pull request, so the effort goes where it will be merged. This page holds the rules every contribution follows; the walkthroughs and reference live under [docs](docs/README.md), starting with [First Contribution](docs/tutorials/first-contribution.md). Everyone taking part is expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/klappe-pm/guardline && cd guardline && python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && pip install -e '.[test,lint]'
```

## Tests

Run the suite before every commit. [Run the Tests](docs/how-to-guides/run-the-tests.md) covers the other checks.

```bash
python3 -m pytest
```

```bash
python3 -m pytest --cov=guardline
```

## Guidelines

- Python 3.11 or newer, standard library only at runtime. `pytest` and `pytest-cov` are the `test` extra, and `ruff` and `mypy` are the `lint` extra.
- Rules are data. A new detection goes in a rule file under `guardline/data/rules/` with an id, a family, a description, a pattern and two examples: one that must fire and one look-alike that must not. See [Add a Rule](docs/how-to-guides/add-a-rule.md).
- Package data is read through `importlib.resources`, never through a path built from `__file__`. See [Package Data](docs/reference/package-data.md).
- Never print, log or return a matched secret. Findings carry the rule id and a position only, and a test proves it.
- Keep every pattern linear: no nested quantifiers, no adjacent overlapping repeats, at most 3 unbounded repeats, every repeat bounded where it can be. The rule loader rejects the unsafe shapes and a test feeds each rule adversarial input.
- Tests read fixtures only: never the live home directory, a real network or a real git remote. Test values are synthetic and assembled from fragments so that no test file holds a complete credential.
- The detection rules in `guardline/data/rules/` name vendors only as the thing they detect.
- Every security fix gets a test that fails without the fix. Revert the fix once to watch the test fail, then restore it.
- Documentation goes in `docs/`, in the folder for its kind: `tutorials/`, `how-to-guides/`, `reference/` or `explanation/`. Headings use Title Case, and each paragraph and list item is one line, not hard-wrapped. Filenames are lowercase kebab-case, apart from the community files and `README.md`.
- Do not use a dash as punctuation. Use a comma, colon, semicolon, period or parentheses, and write ranges as "3 to 5".
- The banner in `.github/` is made by `scripts/make-banner.py`, which needs `fonttools` and nothing else. `fonttools` is a script-only dependency and is not a dependency of the package.
- Everything committed here is public. Never add `models`, `providers` or `session-link` keys to the frontmatter of a Markdown file, never add a session link anywhere, and never credit an agent, model, model provider or agent runtime as author or contributor.
- Agent instruction files and runtime directories at the repository root are gitignored and never tracked.
- Do not copy anything from a private repository: no client names, personal paths, notes, plans or prompts. Examples and fixtures are synthetic.
- Keep any list of private terms to check for (client names, project names) in a file outside the repository, and point `GUARDLINE_FORBIDDEN_TERMS_FILE` at it when you run the tests. Never write such terms in the repository.
- Never commit a secret, credential, private key, `.env` file or `settings.local.json`. `.env.example` with placeholder values is allowed.
- Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## Pull Requests

Keep each pull request to one change, describe what it does and how you tested it, and make sure the test suite, `ruff check`, `ruff format --check` and `mypy` pass. Add a line under Unreleased in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for any user-visible change.

## Roadmap

Open an issue before starting on one of these, so the approach can be agreed first. Each one is a gap that [Security Model](docs/explanation/security-model.md) lists as open.

- [ ] Judge the text a publishing command reads from a file, such as `git commit -F` and `gh pr create --body-file`
- [ ] Recognise more publishing commands and git aliases
- [ ] Detect more programs that print the environment
- [ ] Add rules for more credential formats
